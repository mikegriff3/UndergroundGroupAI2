    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Readability Grade evaluates how accessible and understandable the content is to the intended audience. This measure considers various elements of text composition, such as language simplicity, sentence structure, and the overall organization of information.</p>

    <div class="modal-subtitle">Factors Influencing Readability:</div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Language and Tone:</strong> Analysis of the language's complexity, suitability for the target audience, and the tone's appropriateness for the content's purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure and Organization:</strong> Examination of how well the content is organized, including the use of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and paragraphs to break up text and facilitate easier reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph Design:</strong> Evaluation of paragraph length and structure to ensure text blocks are not too dense, which could hinder readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence Complexity:</strong> Review of sentence length and complexity, preferring shorter, more concise sentences that are easier to understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Consideration of font size, type, spacing, and color contrast to ensure text is easy on the eyes and accessible to people with visual impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Non-Text Elements:</strong> Inclusion of images, charts, and other visual aids to support text content and provide breaks in reading, aiding in better comprehension.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="modal-subtitle">Scoring Method:</div>
    <p>Readability is typically assessed using recognized formulas such as the Flesch Reading Ease or the Gunning Fog Index, which provide a numerical value based on sentence length and word complexity.

                  <div class="modal-subtitle">Definition:</div>
    <p>The Flesch Reading Ease Score is a numerical scale that indicates how easy it is to understand a passage of English text. It was developed by Dr. Rudolf Flesch in the 1940s and is one of the oldest and most accurate readability formulas. The score is calculated based on the average sentence length and the average number of syllables per word.</p>

    <div class="modal-subtitle">How It Is Calculated:</div>
    <p>The formula for the Flesch Reading Ease Score is:</p>
    <p><code>Score = 206.835 - 1.015 × (average sentence length) - 84.6 × (average number of syllables per word)</code></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Average sentence length:</strong> Total number of words divided by the total number of sentences.</li>
        <li><strong>Average number of syllables per word:</strong> Total number of syllables divided by the total number of words.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="modal-subtitle">Why It Is Useful to You:</div>
    <p>The Flesch Reading Ease Score helps content creators evaluate and improve their writing for better accessibility and engagement. A higher score indicates that the text is easier to read and understand, making it suitable for a wider audience. This can be particularly important in environments where clarity and ease of comprehension are crucial, such as in educational content, business communications, and consumer-facing information.</p>
